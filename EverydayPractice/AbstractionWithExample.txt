Abstraction is a process where the implementation of the code is not visible for the end user

1). to declare a class as abstract class use the Keyword Absract
2). In a abstract class we can have both abstract and concrete methods
3). the abstract class can not be instantiated with new() keyword
4). it can not be sealed
5). the abstract methods in this class can be override in child class



Example:

abstract class example1{

public int area(int a){
return a*a;
}

public abstract suuqre(int a);
}

public class child : example{
public override square(int a){
return Math.root(a);
}

public class original : child{
public static void main(string[] args){
original o= new original();
o.square(9);
o.area(3);
}
}
}

diffrence between abstraction and encapsulation is in encasulation we are hiding data of code, in abstraction we are hiding implementation/details of code
