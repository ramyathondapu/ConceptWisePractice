Inheritance is a concept used to get the features of base class into child class

super class : the class which is getting inherited is super class we can call it as base class, parent class also

sub class    : the class which is inheriting super class is subclass we can call it as child class extended class and derived class

Reusability  : with inheritence we can resue the code present in base class also in child class we can have our own methods datatypes and all.


example :

class parent{
  public int add(int a, int b){
  return a+b;
  }
}


class child : parent{

public sub ( int a, int b){
return a-b;
}

public static void main(string[] args){
 child c = new child ();

 c. add(2,3);      .............................. here we are able to acces parent class members also with child class instance
 c.sub (9,8);
}
}
