Structure is user defined datatype only , it also has diffrent types of variables and methods in it same as like class.

but classes are reference type where as structures are value type.

a structure can not have parameter less constructor or destructor

we can not inherit any other class or struct for a struct
 so there is no concept of protected key word here

 any change to a variable we made in class that will effect original value also because we are directly editing value in that addrss as it is reference type
 but any change we made for struct variable with struct refrence that wont effect original value

 classes have heap memory and struct have statck memory

 example:

 struct example{
 
 int a;
 string b;
 bool c;

 example(string b){
 b=this.b;
 }

 public void display(){
 console.writeline(b);
 }
 }
