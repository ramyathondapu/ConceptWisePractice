extension methods

these are used to extend other features for existed class , 

the extension methods present in a static class and these are are of static type only

this first parameter declared using this keyword 

public class calculator{
public int sub(int a, int b){
return a-b;
}

public int mul (int a, int b){
return a*b;
}

public int div(int a, int b){
return a%b;
}
}
public static class example{
static add (this calculator , int a, int b){
return a+b;
}

public static void main(string[] args){
calculator c= new calculator();
c.add(2,3);  ................................. able to call add on calculator class as we extended its feature in extended method
c.sub(78,67);
c.mul(5r,5612);
c.div(26,6);
}
}



in place of inheritence we can use this, here we are not changing original class and for sealed class type we can use this feature.
